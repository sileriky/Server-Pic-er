# Server-Pic-er

This is a Discord bot created using [discord.js](discord.js.org) meant to add various image-related features to a Discord server, as well as other miscellaneous features. 

Packages required:
- [discord.js](discord.js.org)
- [google-images](npmjs.com/package/google-images)

It should be noted that this bot is, for the time being, a personal side project, therefore it is currently scoped to handle a relatively small amount users and servers.
